## 🚀 What's New

- **v0.9.0** Self-developed Core-layer reactive state model migration, timing issues eliminated
- **v0.9.0** Single-path Scene renderer + WebGPU backend (hybrid DOM canvas, no compositeTo), FrameTransaction reactivity, device-lost recovery, auto-fallback WebGPU → WebGL → Canvas2D
- **v0.8** Symbol comparison, multi-source data aggregation
- **v0.7** Renderer registration chain AOP refactoring with decorator syntax, monorepo split, Vue/React bindings (experimental), standalone core package, tokenized color system
- **v0.6.10** Unified WebGL rendering context sharing for all panes, plus sub-pane lifecycle refactoring — centralized pane instance management via SubPaneManager with first-class paneId identity
- **v0.6.6** Comprehensive rendering optimizations: batched price-to-Y calculations, cached tick positions and geometry, optimized month-key operations; achieves stable **190-200fps on 200Hz displays** with frame generation time down to **2ms**
- **v0.6.3** WebGL rendering for K-lines, volume bars, and MACD bars; significant performance boost across the board
- **v0.6.1** Dual-layer canvas architecture: Main + Overlay separation with UpdateLevel filtering, achieves stable **180fps with low jitter on 200Hz displays**
- **v0.6.0** Stateless indicator pipeline: MA/BOLL/EXPMA/ENE/RSI/CCI/STOCH/MOM/WMSR/KST/FASTK now use unified Calculator → Scheduler → StateStore → Renderer architecture for better performance and maintainability
- **v0.5.6** Logarithmic price axis with evenly distributed grid lines at pixel level
- **v0.5.2** Advanced drawing tools: parallel channel, regression channel, smooth top/bottom, and non-intersecting channel
- **v0.5.0** Complete drawing tool system, supporting line, rectangle, text drawing and style editing
- **v0.4** Modern UI, left toolbar, right axis optimization, TradingView-style zoom feel
